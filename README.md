This book has been written, coded and compiled with the aim of making life easier for the long-term stock investor, as it is easy to get lost in the vast amount of data that countless companies listed on the stock exchanges generate.

Given this problem, I decided to explore the daily stock prices and fundamental data of companies with the aim of looking for profitable and financially healthy companies (although nothing written in this book is an investment recommendation).

As the financial market is in constant flux, this book will be too, which is why I'll be updating this book quite frequently and selected GitHub as the mean of publishing (in programmers' parlance: "committing") it.

I've divided this book into two parts:

Fundamentals, where I explain the fundamentals behind the graphs plotted in this book (I recommend bookmarking this page in some way, as you'll want to return to it often).

List of Companies, which have demonstrated good financial health and positive profitability (once again I reiterate: this book does not work with company recommendations).

If you want to contribute with the project, you can modify and/or improve the source code of the book in [Github](https://github.com/JoaoMontanher/Finheim-Main-Book). Also, you can share and discuss ideas for the project in our [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Finheim/) group.

Another thing: When I say "Long-term investment", I mean holding a company in your portfolio for years, not trading methods that promise miraculous high returns in the short term.
